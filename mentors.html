    <p class="text">Our Mentors are the greatest!</p>
    <p class = "text">The ThunderChickens work hours upon hours for six
      weeks to build their robot in order to be ready for competition. In
      addition,  many adult mentors from various industries volunteer their
       time to guide, teach and mentor the students during the build and
       competition season. We send out a big “Thank You” to them all!</p>

       <p class="text">We are extremely lucky to have the wealth of knowledge of three mentors that
         have been with the team since the beginning- Ron Arscheene, Mike Attan, and Bill Baedke. </p>
